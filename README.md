# Path Visualizer
- Developed a web-based application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to solve graph problems using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Implemented interactive graph visualization using the vis.js library to display the problem and solution graphs.
- Created a user-friendly interface with two containers, allowing users to generate random graph problems and visualize the shortest path solution.
